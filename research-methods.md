## Lecture 1

### Computer science

What exactly is **computer science**? It actually is a real broad topic that touches on many different areas:

1. Problem solving / computation
2. (Electronic) hardware and software
3. Information / data
4. Life

Another nice summary would be from the Wikipedia definition:

- Theory
- Experimentation
- Engineering
- Art

It differs in various topic from other sciences and mathematics, but it actually is a unique combination of multiple questions.

### Research questions

So, we want to do some research in Computer Science. A research paper contains a question that we want to answer.

These are some properties that the research question should adhere to:

1. Falsifiable
   - "Does God exists?" is a bad research question as this can be neither proven nor be disproved. 
2. Concrete
   - Put numbers on it, tell which constraints there are under which conditions, etc.
3. Measurable

There are many statistical traps when doing research. As an example, one can do 20 different studies and most likely one study will contain a link with $(p < 0.05)$. There are some things that can help with this:

- Formulate the research question in advance
- Try to disprove your proven theory
- Replication studies

## Lecture 2

**Goal:** $\Pr[\text{My claim is true | observation}]$, or in another way: $1- \Pr[\underbrace{\text{opposite}}_{H_0} \text{ is true | observation}]$
Source of materials for papers:

- Books
  - Text books
  - Monographs
- Wikipedia
- Papers
  - Surveys (Useful for a summary of the current techniques.)
  - Original Research
    - Journals (Useful for the state-of-the-art)
      - Quite some time to review a paper
    - Conference proceedings $\leftarrow$ Peer reviewed
      - Friendly request to fix it, but nobody checks if it's fixed.
      - People only have little time to check the paper.
    - Workshops "proceedings" $\leftarrow$ Not/hardly peer reviewed
  - White papers
- Popular media
- Lecture notes + Slides
- PhD + Master + Bachelor theses
- Course work
- Technical reports (e.g. arXiv)



Journals: there are two experts that check your work over a long period of time. Then if it's accepted, there probably have to be some fixes via the review. Once this has been fixed, it needs to be fixed again.

Conference proceedings are too time constrained, as people only have little time to check the paper. Furthermore, there is only a friendly request to fix it, but nobody checks if it's fixed.

- More focussed on interestingness and relevancy, not so much as it is correct.

If you can and found a conference proceedings, try to find a journal with the same topic as it might be better.

Wikipedia

- Pros: has many different users, as well as details and references 
- Cons: There are some sketchy wikipedia pages and the page itself can be changed, so try to find the reference itself.



Thesis:

- Good thing: It has been thoroughly checked by the teacher.
  PhD also checks of whether it's research worthy.


- Bad thing: It might have gotten a lower grade which you don't know. 
  The job is not to check whether it's worthy of publishing.
  PhD is hundreds of pages and you cannot count that all details are fixed. (Be careful!)

Monographs are like PhD thesis but without the professor reviewing it thoroughly. It might be reviewed but this can be not independent. Don't count too much on too much back and forth reviewing. 

For books - Check for the 2nd edition or something like that.

Lecture notes: sometimes helpful to get some nice figures and references. But might contain mistakes, can disappear so are not the most stable sources.

Technical reports: contains more information than journals/proceedings, but it is not peer-reviewed, although in arXiv there are endorsements.



Blog & Youtube: Look at the author. If the author has a good track record, then it might be considered reliable. Otherwise don't trust it too much.

- DBLP bibliography

Workship "proceedings": look at the number of pages. If there are little pages (4), then there is probably no peer review, but if it was say 10 pages then it might've been properly peer-reviewed.

Course work, never rely on this because:

1. You don't know what grade it got.
2. You don't know the criteria.

Papers from different language: very unreliable if you cannot read the paper and verify what's in there.

Signs of reliable work

1. References
2. Detail
3. Number of users
4. TeX
