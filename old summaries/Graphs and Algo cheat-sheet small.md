## Graphs & Algo cheat-sheet

**Check bipartite:** Look for odd cycles. $G$ is bipartite iff $G$ has no odd cycles. (2-colour, $P$)
**Independent Set:** $I \subseteq V$is independent iff $\neg \exists$ edge between vertices in $I$. $NP$
Max degree $d$, then $\max$ independent set $|I| \geq \frac n {d+1}$.

**Vertex Cover:** Set $S \subseteq V$ such that every edge $(v, w) \in E : v \in S \vee w \in S$. $NP$
$S$ is a vertex cover iff $V \setminus S$ is independent.

**Matching:** Set $M\subseteq E$ such that no vertex $V$ has more than one edge in $E$. $P$
(Also called *independent edge set*.)
**Perfect Matching:** Every vertex is exactly incident to one edge in $M$.
**$X$-saturating matching**: Match all vertices of $X$ in a bipartite graph $(X, Y)$.

- $\max $ Matching $\leq$ $\min $ Vertex Cover. (Equality holds for bipartite graphs.)
- Maximal matching of $M$? Then $\min $ vertex cover $|C|$ is: $|M| \leq |C| \leq |2M|$ 
- **Hall's Theorem**: $G$ has an $X$-saturating matching iff $\forall S \subseteq X$: $|N(S)| \geq |S|$
- A $d$-regular bipartite graph $\implies$ Perfect matching.
- **Tutte-Berge theorem:** $\max M = \min_U \frac 1 2 (n + U - o(G \setminus U))$
- **Tutte's matching theorem:** $G$ has a perfect matching iff  $\forall U\subseteq V$: $o(G \setminus U) \leq |U|$ 

**Dominating set:** Set $S \subseteq V$ such that each vertex is either in $S$ or has a neighbour in $S$.

### Probability theory

$\binom n k \leq \frac{n^k}{k!}$ and $\binom n k \leq (\frac{en} k)^k$ and $\binom n k \leq 2^n$ and finally for $p \in [0, 1]: (1-p)^n \leq e^{-pn}$.

**Markov's inequality:** $\Pr[X \geq a] \leq \frac{\mathbb E[X]} a$ ($X$ non-negative and $a>0$.) 

Probabilistic idea is to randomly assign (or assign with probability $p$) stuff:

1. $\exists i : n_i \geq \mathbb E[X]$ and $\exists_j : n_j \leq \mathbb E[X] $. Useful for expected sizes of certain sets.
2. Consider event $A(X)$. If $\Pr[A(X)] > 0$, then there must exist a value of $X$ where $A$ occurs. Similar vice-versa.

**Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL):** Consider $n$ bad events $A_1, \ldots, A_n$. Futhermore, it holds that $\forall_{1 \leq i \leq n} : \Pr[A_i] \leq p$ and each $A_i$ depends on at most $d$ other events $A_j$.

- Then $ep(d+1) \leq 1 \implies \Pr[\bigcap_i \bar A_i] > 0$.

### Exponential time algorithms

**3-colouring:** Whether you can colour the vertices of a graph with 3 colours.
Checking if $\forall X \subseteq V$ whether $X$ is independent $\rightarrow$ if $G(V\setminus X)$ is `2-colourable`? $O^*(2^n)$  

**Vertex cover:** Considering the $k$ decision variant, i.e. vertex cover of at most size $k$.
Brute force: $O^*(2^n)$ by checking all $2^n$ subsets or all $\sum_{i=0}^k \binom n k$ subsets.
For a random edge, add either $u$ or $v$ and continue recursively on $k-1$ edges: $O^*(2^k)$.
â€‹For $u \in V$ where $deg(u) \geq 2$, either add $u$ or add all neighbours: $O^*(1.62^k)$.

**Cluster editing:** Graph is cluster graph if all connected components are cliques. Look for $X$ such that $(V, E \triangle X)$ is a cluster graph. Look for induced $P_3: uv, vw \in E \wedge uw \notin E$.
Recurse by either add $uw$, remove $uv$ or remove $vw$ on $k-1$: $O^*(3^k)$.

**Feedback Vertex Set:** Set $X \subseteq V$ such that $G[V \setminus X]$ is a forest, i.e. any cycle has $\geq$ one vertex in $X$. Solvable with *iterative compression*: given solution of $k+1$, compress to $k$.

### Dynamic Programming + Inclusion / Exclusion

**Knapsack:** Given $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ and $v_1, \ldots, v_n$, pick $X \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ to maximize $\sum_{e \in X} v_e$ while $\sum_{e \in X} w_e \leq W$. $A[i,j]$ is $\max \left\{\sum_{e \in X}v_e\text{ with }X \subseteq \{1, \ldots, i\}\text{ and } \sum_{e \in X} w_e \leq j \right\}$.

**$k$-colouring**: $A_k[X]$ is true of it has a $k$-colouring. Recursion: try all subsets $Y \subseteq X$ and look for $A_{k-1}[X \setminus Y] \wedge A_1[Y]$, where the latter checks if it is an independent set. $O^*(3^n)$. 

**TSP:** Find cycle $C$ such that $V[C] = V$ and $\omega(V[C])$ is minimized.
*Walk:* Sequence vertices such that their edges are consecutively connected on $G$.
*Path:* Walk while only visiting each vertex once.
*Cyclic walk:* Walk such that we start and end in the first vertex.
*Cycle:* Path such that we start and end in the first vertex.
Pick arbitrary $s$, define $A_t[X] = \min\{\omega (E[P]):\text{$P$ is a path from $s$ to $t$ using vertices V[X]}\}$.
Recursion works by looking for the minimum path of: $\{$in-neighbours $t' + \omega(t',t)\}$ where $t'$ also has to be in $X$. $O^*(2^n)$, as we need to consider all subsets $X \subseteq V$.

**Inclusion/Exclusion:** calculate union via sum of intersection and vice versa:
$$
\left|\bigcap _{i=1}^n P_i\right| = \sum_{F \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}} (-1)^{|F|} \left|\bigcap_{i \in F} \bar P_i \right|
$$
One can think of $P_i$ as *good properties*. Note: $\bar P_i = U \setminus P_i$ and $|\bigcap_i P_i| = |U \setminus \bigcup _i \bar P_i|$.

**Hamiltonian cycle:** Consider $P_i$ as a cyclic walk of length $n$ visiting vertex $i$. Then $| \bigcup_{i \in F} \bar P_i|$ are all cyclic walks not visiting $F$ $\equiv$ all cyclic walks of length $n$ of $V \setminus F$. 
DP solution: $w_F(s, t', k)$ is #walks $s \rightarrow t$ of length $k$, and recurse / sum over all $N^-(t) \setminus F$.

### Treewidth

**Tree decomposition:** Pair $X, T$ where $X = \{X_1, \ldots, X_l\}$ are bags, with $X_i \subseteq V$. $T$ is the tree on $X_i$. 1. $\bigcup_{i=1}^l X_i = V$. 2. Edge in $G$? Then $u$ and $v$ should be in at least one $X_i$ together.  3. All $X_i$ containing $v$ are connected.
**Width:** $\max_{i=1}^n |X_i| - 1$. **Treewidth:** Minimum width of all tree decompositions.

**Cops and robbers:** $w+1$ cops can win iff graph has treewidth $\leq w$.

We can create **Nice tree decompositions** in polynomial time:
**Introduce:** Bag with one child and $X_i = X_j \cup v$. **Leaf:** $|X_i| = 1$.
**Forget:** Bag with one child and $X_i = X_j \setminus v$. **Join:** Bag with two children, $X_i = X_j = X_{j'}$.

Given planar graph and rooted spanning tree $S$ of $G$ of at most height $h$ ( $\max$ # edges root $\rightarrow$ leaf), then a tree decomposition of $G$ of width $\leq3h$ can be found in poly time.
Removing vertices and edges from a graph does not increase treewidth.
**Planar graph:** Can be drawn without overlapping edges. ($O(n^2)$ or even $O(n)$)
**Euler's formula:** If $G$ is planar and connected, then $n - m + f = 2$ ($m$ edges, $f$ faces).

**Contracting** an edge: merge $u$ and $v$ into $w$ with neighbours of $u$ and $v$.
Graph $H$ is a minor of $G$ if it can be obtained by contracting only.
**Grid Minor Theorem:** $\forall l \in \mathbb N:$ all planar graphs have either $(l \times l)$-grid as a minor or Treewidth at most $9l$. This can be found in polynomial time
**Kuratowski's theorem:** $G$ is planar iff it has no $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ as minor.

### Randomized Algorithms (expected running times here)

**Incremental construction:** First randomly permute the input objects. Then add objects one by one in a list, maintaining a partial solution $1 \ldots i$. Then add $i+1$ to the list.

**Backward analysis:** Calculate $\mathbb E[\mathcal I_i]$ in backward direction. Currently at $Sol(i)$, want to go back to $Sol(i-1)$. Sorting example: $s_1, \ldots, s_i$ are already sorted. Remove $s_k$, affects points $L_{k-1}=(s_{k-1}, s_{k+1})$. Prob of picking interval is $\frac 1 i$. $\mathbb E[\mathcal I _i]=\frac{|L_1|} i + \cdots + \frac{|L_i|} i \leq \frac{2n} i$.

**Convex hull:** For each point within $C_i$, make a bidirectional pointer to edge $e$ of $C_i$, by intersection with origin. New point $p_{i+1}$ outside? Delete intersected edge + points and walk along $C$ to remove vertices until convex hull good again $O(n)$. Then update all pointers that pointed to the removed edges to the 2 new edges.
Backwards analysis: Have $|C_i| \leq i$ . Remove random point $p_k$. Inside? Done. On $C_i$? Remove two edges. Let $|e|$ be #points pointing to $e$. Then $\mathbb E[\mathcal I_i]=\sum_{e \in C_i} \frac {2|e|} i \leq O(\frac n i)$. 

**Karger's min cut algorithm:** Want to find $S$ such that edges between $S$ and $\bar S$ is minimized. **Contraction:** Same as in Treewidth, but we can have multiple edges now.
Choose random edge $e$ and contract until 2 vertices are left.  Suppose $k$ min-cut. Then $\forall_{v \in V} d(v) \geq k$ and thus $m \geq \frac{nk} 2$.  $O(n^4)$. Speed up version after recursion: $O(n^2 \log n)$.

### Probabilistic exponential time algorithms

*Algorithms that output **true** with a certain probability ($1-\frac 1 e$), but never a false positive.*

**Stirling's approximation:** $n! \approx \binom n e$ for $O^*(n)$ algorithms. 

**k-path:** Given directed graph, determine whether $k$-path exists. N
Note: for DAGs, solvable in $O^*(1)$ time via simple DP. 
General $k$-path 1: randomly assign numbers $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ to vertices. Transform into DAG by only keeping consecutive edges. Look for $k$-path. Probability $\frac 1 {k^k}$, so need to repeat this $k^k$ time. 
General $k$-path 2: randomly assign colours $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ to vertices. Look for *colourful* $k$-path via DP: Check whether all different-coloured in-neighbours have a solution for $k-1$ colours, namely $X \setminus c(v)$. $O^*(2^k)$. Doing this check $e^k$ times for c.e.p., so $O^*((2e)^k)$. 

**FVS 2:** Lemma: $|X| \geq \frac {|E|}2$. Algorithm: first remove edge cases $(v, v)$, $deg(v) \leq 2$. Then pick an edge + its endpoint at random, probability of $\frac 1 4$ of being in $X$. Recurse on $k-1$.
Need to repeat this at most $4^k$ time as probability is $\frac 1 {4^k}$ of getting correct FVS. $O^*(4^k)$W

**Rank nullity-Theorem:** 
**Isolation**: given family $F \subseteq 2^U$ and weight function $\omega$, $\omega$ isolates $F$ if there is a unique $S \in F$ such that $\omega(S) = \min_{S'\in F} \omega(S')$. I.e. $\exists$ unique set that has the min value of all sets in $F$.
**Isolation Lemma:** For every $e \in U$, choose $\omega(e) \in \{1, \ldots, N\}$ at random. So randomly assignment numbers a set results in a unique minimizing set $\Pr[\omega \text{ isolates } F] \geq 1 - \frac{|U|} N$ 

### Matrix multiplications

We can multiply two matrices in $O(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega \leq 2.37$. ($\omega \approx 2.81$ in lecture notes)
For graph $G$ with adjacency matrix $A$. Define $B=A^2$, then $b_{ik}=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}a_{jk}$ is the # of walks on two edges from $v_i$ to $v_k$. $A^3$ contains # of 3-walks.
**Triangle count:** Compute $trace(A^3)/6$, where the /6 comes from the fact that one can start at three vertices in two directions and $trace(A) = \sum_{i=1}^m a_{ii}$, sum of diagonal. 
**Square:** We can compute the square of a graph $G$ in $O(n^\omega)$ time. The square of $G$ is $G'$ where we put an edge between each vertex of distance $\leq 2$.

### Spectral Graph Theory

**Laplacian Matrix:** Diagonal entires are the degree of vertex $i$, while if there exists an edge between $v_i$ and $v_j$, then $(L_G)_{ij} = -1$. Eigenvalues are $\lambda_1, \leq \lambda_2 \le \cdots \le \lambda_n$, whose corresponding eigenvector $v_i$ are orthogonal to each other and have length $||v_i||^2=1$.

**Laplacian quadratic form:** For any vector $x \in \mathbb R^n: x^TL_Gx = \sum_{(i,j) \in E} (x_i - x_j)^2$. 
Can think of this as placing a value of $x_i$ on vertex $i$, then $(x_i - x_j)^2$ defines the length of the edge. Also, we can decompose every graph as $L_G = \sum_{(i,j) \in E} L_{i,j}$.
Every eigenvalue is non-negative and it holds that: $\lambda_i = v_i^TL_Gv_i$
$\lambda_1 = 0$ and $v_1$ is a scaling of the all-ones vector. For the rest: $$\lambda_i = \min_{x:x\perp v_1, \ldots, v_{i-1}}{\frac{x^TLx}{x^Tx}}$$
Suppose the graph has $k$ disconnected components, then $\lambda_1 = \cdots = \lambda_k = 0$.

Let $G$ be a connected, $d$-regular graph. $\lambda_n = 2d$ iff $G$ is bipartite.
**Expansion:** $\phi_G(S) = \frac{E[S,V\setminus S]}{d|S|}$. For $d$-regular graph $G$: $$\frac{\lambda_2}{2d} \leq \phi(G) \leq \sqrt\frac{2 \lambda_2} d$$
