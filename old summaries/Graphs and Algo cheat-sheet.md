# Graphs & Algo cheat-sheet

**Check bipartite:** Look for odd cycles. $G$ is bipartite iff $G$ has no odd cycles. (2-colour, $P$)
**Independent Set:** $I \subseteq V$is independent iff $\neg \exists$ edge between vertices in $I$. $NP$

- Max degree $d$, then $\max$ independent set $|I| \geq \frac n {d+1}$. 

**Vertex Cover:** Set $S \subseteq V$ such that every edge $(v, w) \in E : v \in S \vee w \in S$. $NP$

- $S$ is a vertex cover iff $V \setminus S$ is independent.

**Matching:** Set $M\subseteq E$ such that no vertex $V$ has more than one edge in $E$. $P$
(Also called *independent edge set*.)
**Perfect Matching:** Every vertex is exactly incident to one edge in $M$.
**$X$-saturating matching**: Match all vertices of $X$ in a bipartite graph $(X, Y)$.

- $\max $ Matching $\leq$ $\min $ Vertex Cover. (Equality holds for bipartite graphs.)
- Maximal matching of $M$? Then $\min $ vertex cover $|C|$ is: $|M| \leq |C| \leq |2M|$ 
- **Hall's Theorem**: $G$ has an $X$-saturating matching iff $\forall S \subseteq X$: $|N(S)| \geq |S|$
- A $d$-regular bipartite graph $\implies$ Perfect matching.
- **Tutte-Berge theorem:** $\max M = \min_U \frac 1 2 (n + U - o(G \setminus U))$
- **Tutte's matching theorem:** $G$ has a perfect matching iff  $\forall U\subseteq V$: $o(G \setminus U) \leq |U|$ 

**Dominating set:** Set $S \subseteq V$ such that each vertex is either in $S$ or has a neighbour in $S$.

### Probability theory

$\binom n k \leq \frac{n^k}{k!}$ and $\binom n k \leq (\frac{en} k)^k$ and $\binom n k \leq 2^n$ and finally for $p \in [0, 1]: (1-p)^n \leq e^{-pn}$.

**Markov's inequality:** $\Pr[X \geq a] \leq \frac{\mathbb E[X]} a$ ($X$ non-negative and $a>0$.) 

**Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL):** Consider $n$ bad events $A_1, \ldots, A_n$. 

- It also holds that $\forall_{1 \leq i \leq n} : \Pr[A_i] \leq p$ and each $A_i$ depends on at most $d$ other events $A_j$.
- Then $ep(d+1) \leq 1 \implies \Pr[\bigcap_i \bar A_i] > 0$.

Probabilistic idea is to randomly assign (or assign with probability $p$) stuff:

1. $\exists i : n_i \geq \mathbb E[X]$ and $\exists_j : n_j \leq \mathbb E[X] $. This can be useful for expected sizes of certain sets.
2. Consider event $A(X)$. If $\Pr[A(X)] > 0$, then there must exist a value of $X$ where $A$ occurs.
   Similar vice-versa.

### Exponential time algorithms

**4-CNF-SAT**: $(v_4 \vee \neg v_3 \vee v_2 \vee v_1) \wedge (v_2 \vee v_6 \vee v_5\vee \neg v_3) \wedge (\neg v_3 \vee v_5 \vee \neg v_4 \vee v_1)$. 
$n$ variables, $m$ clauses, $k$-CNF-SAT with clauses of size at most $k$.

**3-colouring:** Whether you can colour the vertices of a graph with 3 colours.
Checking if $\forall X \subseteq V$ whether $X$ is independent $\rightarrow$ if $G(V\setminus X)$ is `2-colourable`? $O^*(2^n)$  

**Vertex cover:** Considering the $k$ decision variant, i.e. vertex cover of at most size $k$.
Brute force: $O^*(2^n)$ by checking all $2^n$ subsets or all $\sum_{i=0}^k \binom n k$ subsets.
For a random edge, add either $u$ or $v$ and continue recursively on $k-1$ edges: $O^*(2^k)$.
â€‹For $u \in V$ where $deg(u) \geq 2$, either add $u$ or add all neighbours: $O^*(1.62^k)$.

**Cluster editing:** Graph is cluster graph if all connected components are cliques. Look for $X$ such that $(V, E \triangle X)$ is a cluster graph. Look for induced $P_3: uv, vw \in E \wedge uw \notin E$.
Recurse by either add $uw$, remove $uv$ or remove $vw$ on $k-1$: $O^*(3^k)$.

**Feedback Vertex Set:** Set $X \subseteq V$ such that $G[V \setminus X]$ is a forest, i.e. any cycle has at least one vertex in $X$. We'll use *iterative compression* here. $O^*(8^k)$
Given FVS of size $k+1$, see if you can reduce it to $k$. Start with $|X| = k$, then iteratively add to $n$. If reduction was unsuccessful, then $|X| = k+1$ and we return False.

**Subset sum:** Given integers $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ and see if any subset sums up to $t$.
Let $L$ be sum of all subsets until $\frac 1 2 n$, $R$ be the subsets till $n$, use 2-SUM: $O^*(2^{n/2})$  

### Dynamic Programming

**Subset sum:** $A[i,j]$ is true if $\exists X \subseteq \{1, \ldots, i\}$ such that $\sum_{e \in X} w_e = j$. $O(nt)$

**Knapsack:** Given $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ and $v_1, \ldots, v_n$, pick $X \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ to maximize $\sum_{e \in X} v_e$ while $\sum_{e \in X} w_e \leq W$. $A[i,j]$ is $\max \left\{\sum_{e \in X}v_e\text{ with }X \subseteq \{1, \ldots, i\}\text{ and } \sum_{e \in X} w_e \leq j \right\}$.

**$k$-colouring**: $A_k[X]$ is true of it has a $k$-colouring. Recursion: try all subsets $Y \subseteq X$ and look for $A_{k-1}[X \setminus Y] \wedge A_1[Y]$, where the latter checks if it is an independent set. $O^*(3^n)$. 

**TSP:** Find cycle $C$ such that $V[C] = V$ and $\omega(V[C])$ is minimized.
*Walk:* Sequence vertices such that their edges are consecutively connected on $G$.
*Path:* Walk while only visiting each vertex once.
*Cyclic walk:* Walk such that we start and end in the first vertex.
*Cycle:* Path such that we start and end in the first vertex.
Pick arbitrary $s$, define $A_t[X] = \min\{\omega (E[P]):\text{$P$ is a path from $s$ to $t$ using vertices V[X]}\}$.
Recursion works by looking for the minimum path of: $\{$in-neighbours $t' + \omega(t',t)\}$ where $t'$ also has to be in $X$. $O^*(2^n)$, as we need to consider all subsets $X \subseteq V$.

**Weighted Independent Set on trees:** Pick the maximum $\{(\omega(v) + \sum_{c_1 \in ch(v)} \sum_{c_2 \in ch(c_1)} T[c_2])$ or $(\sum_{c \in ch(v)} T[c])\}$. So we either include $v$ and continue with grandchildren or exclude $v$.

### Inclusion / Exclusion

Useful if we need a union of sets while we can only calculate the intersection and vice versa.
$$
\left|\bigcap _{i=1}^n P_i\right| = \sum_{F \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}} (-1)^{|F|} \left|\bigcap_{i \in F} \bar P_i \right|
$$
One can think of $P_i$ as *good properties*. Note: $\bar P_i = U \setminus P_i$ and $|\bigcap_i P_i| = |U \setminus \bigcup _i \bar P_i|$.

**Hamiltonian cycle:** Consider $P_i$ as a cyclic walk of length $n$ visiting vertex $i$. Then $| \bigcup_{i \in F} \bar P_i|$ are all cyclic walks not visiting $F$ $\equiv$ all cyclic walks of length $n$ of $V \setminus F$. 
DP solution: $w_F(s, t', k)$ is #walks $s \rightarrow t$ of length $k$, and recurse / sum over all $N^-(t) \setminus F$.

### Treewidth

**Tree decomposition:** Pair $X, T$ where $X = \{X_1, \ldots, X_l\}$ are bags, with $X_i \subseteq V$. $T$ is the tree on $X_i$. 1. $\bigcup_{i=1}^l X_i = V$. 2. Edge in $G$? Then $u$ and $v$ should be in at least one $X_i$ together.  3. All $X_i$ containing $v$ are connected.
**Width:** $\max_{i=1}^n |X_i| - 1$. **Treewidth:** Minimum width of all tree decompositions.

**Cops and robbers:** $w+1$ cops can win iff graph has treewidth $\leq w$.

Given planar graph and a rooted spanning tree $S$ of $G$ of at most height $h$ (max # edges from root to leaf), then a tree decomposition of $G$ of width $\leq3h$ can be found in poly time.
Removing vertices and edges from a graph does not increase treewidth.

We can create **Nice tree decompositions** in polynomial time:
**Introduce:** Bag with one child and $X_i = X_j \cup v$. **Leaf:** $|X_i| = 1$.
**Forget:** Bag with one child and $X_i = X_j \setminus v$. **Join:** Bag with two children, $X_i = X_j = X_{j'}$.

Weighted independent set algorithm given in slides.

**Planar graph:** Can be drawn without overlapping edges. ($O(n^2)$ or even $O(n)$)
**Euler's formula:** If $G$ is planar and connected, then $n - m + f = 2$ ($m$ edges, $f$ faces).

**Contracting** an edge: merge $u$ and $v$ into $w$ with neighbours of $u$ and $v$.
Graph $H$ is a minor of $G$ if it can be obtained by contracting only.
**Grid Minor Theorem:** $\forall l \in \mathbb N:$ all planar graphs have either $(l \times l)$-grid as a minor or Treewidth at most $9l$. This can be found in polynomial time
**Kuratowski's theorem:** $G$ is planar iff it has no $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ as minor.

### Randomized Algorithms (expected running times here)

**Incremental construction:** First randomly permute the input objects. Then add objects one by one in a list, maintaining a partial solution $1 \ldots i$. Then add $i+1$ to the list.

**Backward analysis:** Calculate $\mathbb E[\mathcal I_i]$ in backward direction. Currently at $Sol(i)$, want to go back to $Sol(i-1)$. Sorting example: $s_1, \ldots, s_i$ are already sorted. Remove $s_k$, affects points $L_{k-1}=(s_{k-1}, s_{k+1})$. Prob of picking interval is $\frac 1 i$. $\mathbb E[\mathcal I _i]=\frac{|L_1|} i + \cdots + \frac{|L_i|} i \leq \frac{2n} i$.

**Convex hull:** For each point in $C_i$, make a bidirectional pointer to edge $e$ of $C_i$, by means of intersection with origin. New point $p_{i+1}$ outside? Delete intersected edge + points and walk along $C$ to remove vertices until convex hull good again $O(n)$. 
Then update all pointers that pointed to the removed edges to the 2 new edges.
Backwards analysis: Have $|C_i| \leq i$ . Remove random point $p_k$. Inside? Do nothing. On $C_i$? Remove two edges. Let $|e|$ be #points pointing to $e$. Then $\mathbb E[\mathcal I_i]=\sum_{e \in C_i} \frac {2|e|} i \leq O(\frac n i)$. 

**Karger's min cut algorithm:** Want to find $S$ such that edges between $S$ and $\bar S$ is minimized.
**Contraction:** Same as in Treewidth, but we can have multiple edges now.
Choose random edge $e$ and contract until 2 vertices are left.  Suppose $k$ min-cut. Then $\forall_{v \in V} d(v) \geq k$ and thus $m \geq \frac{nk} 2$.  $O(n^4)$. Speed up version after recursion: $O(n^2 \log n)$.

### Probabilistic exponential time algorithms

*Algorithms that output **true** with a certain probability ($1-\frac 1 e$), but never a false positive.*

**Stirling's approximation:** $n! \approx \binom n e$ for $O^*(n)$ algorithms. 

**k-path:** Given directed graph, determine whether $k$-path exists. Note: for DAGs, solvable in $O^*(1)$ time via simple DP. 
General $k$-path 1: randomly assign numbers $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ to vertices. Transform into DAG by only keeping consecutive edges. Look for $k$-path. Probability $\frac 1 {k^k}$, so need to repeat this $k^k$ time. 
General $k$-path 2: randomly assign colours $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ to vertices. Look for *colourful* $k$-path via DP: Check whether all different-coloured in-neighbours have a solution for $k-1$ colours, namely $X \setminus c(v)$. $O^*(2^k)$. Doing this check $e^k$ times for c.e.p., so $O^*((2e)^k)$. 

**Schoning's algorithm for $k$-CNF-SAT:** Use hamming distance ($H(00101, 10110)$ = 3).
**Local search:** Given $x$, see if we can satisfy $y$ with $\leq d$ edits: if $\exists$ clause not satisfied, then flip all literals independently and see if we can solve one of the `localsearch`$(\phi, x', d-1)$. $O(k^d)$
**Algorithm:** Pick uniformly $x \in \{0, 1\}^n$ at random. $d = \frac{n}{k+1}$. Check if `localSearch` returns true. Repeat for $2^n/\binom n d$ times. Results in $O^*((\frac{2k}{k+1})^n)$ algorithm.

**FVS 2:** Lemma: $|X| \geq \frac {|E|}2$. Algorithm: first remove edge cases $(v, v)$, $deg(v) \leq 2$. Then pick an edge + its endpoint at random, probability of $\frac 1 4$ of being in $X$. Recurse on $k-1$.
Need to repeat this at most $4^k$ time as probability is $\frac 1 {4^k}$ of getting correct FVS. $O^*(4^k)$

### $k$-path in $O(2^k)$

$\mathbb Z_2^k = $ set of $k$-dimensional binary vectors. $1110 + 1011 = 0101, \langle 1110, 1011 \rangle = 0$. Two vectors are orthogonal if $\langle x, y \rangle = 0$. **Rank-Nullity Theorem:** If $x^1, \ldots, x^n \in \mathbb Z^k_2$, #vectors y$\in \mathbb Z^k_2$ satisfying $\forall_{1\leq i \leq n}\langle x^i, y \rangle = 0$ is $2^{k-rk(x^1, \ldots, x^n)}$

Algorithm: randomly assign each vertex $c(v) \in \mathbb Z_2^k$. Then check whether $G$ has a linearly independent $k$-path, which can be done in $O^*(2^k)$ time. Simpler, because walks $\Rightarrow$ paths.

Lemma: If we assign each vertex a binary $k$-vector at random, then the probability that a $k$-path is linearly independent is $\geq \frac 1 4$. 

Rank-Nullity theorem implies $\sum_{y\in \mathbb Z^k_2} w_{ORTH(y)}(k)$, where $w_{ORTH(y)}(k)$ the number of $k$-walks on all vertices orthogonal to $y$ when calculating modulo 2.
**Isolation**: given family $F \subseteq 2^U$ and weight function $\omega$, $\omega$ isolates $F$ if there is a unique $S \in F$ such that $\omega(S) = \min_{S'\in F} \omega(S')$. I.e. there is a unique set that has the minimum value of all sets in $F$.
**Isolation Lemma:** For every $e \in U$, choose $\omega(e) \in \{1, \ldots, N\}$ at random. So randomly assignment numbers a set results in a unique minimizing set $\Pr[\omega \text{ isolates } F] \geq 1 - \frac{|U|} N$ 

We let the universe be all edges, and assign $\{1, \ldots, 2|E|\}$ to each edge. Then w.p. $\geq$ 1/2 there exists a unique min-weight linearly independent $k$-path. Then we calculate the term for each weight $W$, and with probability at least $1/2$ there is a unique $k$-path that satisfies this, thus we get our uneven term in the mod 2. Then, if there is one where sum=1, then we have found it.

### Matrix multiplications

We can multiply two matrices in $O(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega \leq 2.37$. ($\omega \approx 2.81$ in lecture notes)
For graph $G$ with adjacency matrix $A$. Define $B=A^2$, then $b_{ik}=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}a_{jk}$ is the number of walks on two edges from $v_i$ to $v_k$. So $A^3$ contains the number of 3-walks. 
**Triangle count:** Compute $trace(A^3)/6$, where the /6 comes from the fact that one can start at three vertices in two directions and $trace(A) = \sum_{i=1}^m a_{ii}$, sum of diagonal. 
**Max weighted triangle:** Let $a_{i,j} = n^{3\omega(v_i, v_j)}$ and $C=A^3$. Then $c_{ii} = n^{3(\omega(v_i, v_j) + \omega(v_j, v_k) + \omega(v_k, v_i))}$. Let OPT be the max weight triangle for vertex $v_i$. If OPT exists, then $c_{ii} \geq n^{3OPT}$, otherwise $c_ii < n^{3OPT}$ (as in the worst case, there are $n^2$ triangle of val $n^{3OPT-1}$ < $n^{3OPT}$). So just have max integer $c$ such that $c_{i,i} \geq n^c$ and then go over diagonals and find max $c_{i,i}$.
**Max-2-SAT:** Find maximum number of satisfying clauses.

### Spectral Graph Theory

**Laplacian Matrix:** Diagonal entires are the degree of vertex $i$, while if there exists an edge between $v_i$ and $v_j$, then $(L_G)_{ij} = -1$. Eigenvalues are $\lambda_1, \leq \lambda_2 \le \cdots \le \lambda_n$, whose corresponding eigenvector $v_i$ are orthogonal to eachother and have length $||v_i||^2=1$.

**Laplacian quadratic form:** For any vector $x \in \mathbb R^n: x^TL_Gx = \sum_{(i,j) \in E} (x_i - x_j)^2$. 
Can think of this as placing a value of $x_i$ on vertex $i$, then $(x_i - x_j)^2$ defines the length of the edge. Also, we can decompose every graph as $L_G = \sum_{(i,j) \in E} L_{i,j}$.

Every eigenvalue is non-negative and it holds that: $\lambda_i = v_i^TL_Gv_i$

$\lambda_1 = 0$ and $v_1$ is a scaling of the all-ones vector. For the rest: 
$$
\lambda_i = \min_{x:x\perp v_1, \ldots, v_{i-1}}{\frac{x^TLx}{x^Tx}}
$$
Suppose the graph has $k$ disconnected components, then $\lambda_1 = \cdots = \lambda_k = 0$.

Let $G$ be a connected, d-regular graph. $\lambda_n = 2d$ iff $G$ is bipartite.

Finally, define expension as $\phi_G(S) = \frac{E[S,V\setminus S]}{d|S|}$. Then for a d-regular graph $G$:
$$
\frac{\lambda_2}{2d} \leq \phi(G) \leq \sqrt\frac{2 \lambda_2} d
$$
